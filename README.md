# i Guy does Python

Are you ready to start the journey to open source and Python? These pages will walk you down the path of things you need to know to get started.

I started coding Python in 2005 and haven't looked back. As with any worthwhile pursuit there have been bumps in the road, but today I use Python daily to build:

* web applications
* desktop applications
* batch scripts to be run on a scheduler
* PDF reports/document
* Excel documents
* integrate with remote API
* and much more

Throughout these documents I'll discuss what I think is the best way to tackle a task. As with everything in open source, there is more than one way to do something. The content here is based on my experience and my opinion, don't read more into it than that.

We'll break things down as follows

1. Linux
2. Python
3. Common Python Packages
4. Python Web Frameworks
5. Getting started with Open Source on IBM i
6. Python on IBM i
